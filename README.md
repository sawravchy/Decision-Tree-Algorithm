<h2> Overview: </h2>


Decision tree is one of the simplest methods for supervised learning. It can be applied to both regression and classification.At each node of a tree, a test is applied which sends the query sample down one of the branches of the node.This continues until the query sample arrives at a terminal or leaf node. Each leaf node is associated with a value: a class label in classification, or numeric value in regression.The value of the leaf node reached by the query sample is returned as the output of the tree.An attribute or feature is a characteristic of the situation that we can measure.
